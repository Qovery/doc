[**Qovery**](https://www.qovery.com) **helps developers to deploy their application in the Cloud \(AWS\) in just a few seconds.**

```python
if (qovery.use == "first time") {
    quickstart();
} else {
    extendingQovery();
}
```

If you want the **fastest way** to get your application built and deployed, start with the [Quickstart](quickstart/sign-up.md) and it will be done in **less than 5 min**.

**To know more** about supported Qovery services, you can read the [Services](services/network/) section. **To go further** with what can Qovery offers, read the Extending Qovery section.

**To better understand** how Qovery works under the wood, read the [Concepts](concepts.md) page.
