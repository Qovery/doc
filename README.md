\*\*\*\*[**Qovery**](https://www.qovery.com) **helps growing tech companies to accelerate and scale application development cycle with zero infrastructure management investment.**

```python
if (qovery.use == "first time") {
    quickstart();
} else {
    extendingQovery();
}
```

If you want the **fastest way** to get your application built and deployed, start with the [Quickstart](quickstart/sign-up/) and it will be done in **less than 5 min**.

**To know more** about supported Qovery services, you can read the [Services](services/network/) section. **To go further** with what can Qovery offers, read the [Extending Qovery](extending-qovery/branches.md) section.

**To better understand** how Qovery works under the wood, read the [Concepts](concepts.md) page.

For the Qovery account management part \(Users accounts, Projects management, Payment etc...\) the [Administration](administration/management-interface/) section is made for you.
