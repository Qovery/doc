# Welcome

Welcome to [Qovery](https://www.qovery.com) documentation!

Qovery helps growing tech companies to accelerate and scale application development cycle with zero infrastructure management investment.

```python
if First_Time:
    Quickstart
else:

```

If you want the **fastest way** to get your application built and deployed, start with the [Quickstart](quickstart/sign-up.md) and it will be done in **less than 5 min**.

To know more about supported Qovery services, you can read the [Services](services-1/network/) section. To go further with what can Qovery offers, read the [Extending Qovery](extending-qovery/branches.md) section.

To better understand how Qovery works under the wood, read the [Concepts](concepts.md) page.

For the account management part \(Users accounts, Projects management, Payment etc...\) the [Administration](administration/management-interface/) section is made for you.
