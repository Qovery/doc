# Monitoring & Alerts

**Monitoring, Observability and alerting are mandatory for applications in production**. Without that, it is almost impossible to really what's happen on your applications.

However **deploying all the required tools** to get relevant information is something **complex and long to setup**. That's why **Qovery automate all this part** for you and brings useful information about your applications and dependencies.

You'll find in the Health Monitoring section, the ways to **enhance your application availability and reliability**:

To **observe your application** performances and availability:

{% page-ref page="observability.md" %}

Configure the way you want to be notified:
