# Auto-Scaling

**Managing your application resources** when you're in a development phase, **is never an easy part**. Even more, most of the time it's **nearly impossible for developers** to exactly know how resources will be used.

In traditional medium/large industries, Ops/System Administrators/DevOps are requiring those information to **provision resources for production usage**. This to ensure the requested resources are aligned with the available resources and financially planned projects \(also called [Capacity planing](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Capacity_management)\). This is ideal for companies financial planning, but **this is a nightmare and a waste of time for developers and companies.**

We decided to **simplify** this, by managing resources per project and not per application.

{% hint style="success" %}
You don't have to care about managing your application resources. **We scale your applications automatically if their response are not good enough or if their consuming resources are too high.**
{% endhint %}

**Resources usage will be automatically reported** to the Web interface**. You'll know what resources you're consuming per application in the time.**
