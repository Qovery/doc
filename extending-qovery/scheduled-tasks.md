# Scheduled tasks

Scheduled tasks are useful to create **periodic and recurring tasks**. Here are some useful use cases:

* **Cleaning data content**: your application has to throw out unused data or temporary data. Every hour a cleaning job contact your application to request cleaning
* **Run backups**: perform regular backups of some type of your data \(eg: after manipulation\) every day
* **Send mails**: being able to send emailings every week
