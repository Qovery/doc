# FAQ

## What is the difference between a Project, an Application and an Environment?

A project is the site that you're working on. Each project can contain multiple applications and be deployed in their own environments.

An environment is a standalone copy of your site, complete with code, data, and running services. The master branch is the production environment, while any other branch can be setup as an otherwise identical testing environment.
