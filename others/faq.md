# FAQ

## What is the difference between a Project, an Application and an Environment?

A project is the site that you're working on. Each project can contain multiple applications and be deployed in their own environments.

An environment is a standalone copy of your site, complete with code, data, and running services. The master branch is the production environment, while any other branch can be setup as an otherwise identical testing environment. 

## Is Qovery production ready?

Not yet, the product is currently in beta. We hope having a production ready version for February 2020.

## Where are located your servers?

Qovery rely on the excellent AWS \(Amazon Web Services\) infrastructure. Qovery is available in United States, Canada, South America, Europe, Africa, Asia.
