# Sign Up

To sign up using [Qovery CLI](../extending-qovery/cli.md), it's simple:

{% hint style="info" %}
First of all,[ **install Qovery CLI**](../extending-qovery/cli.md).
{% endhint %}

Then, run this command:

```text
qovery auth
```

You'll get a window open on your browser to link with your account. In this example we chose GitHub :

We need to access to your account to be able to clone your repository for future application build:

![](../.gitbook/assets/github_connect.png)

Then we need to validate it on our side:

![](../.gitbook/assets/github_auth.png)

That's it, you should have a message saying: "_Authentication successful. You can close this window_."
