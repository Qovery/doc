# Caching \(CDN\)

A content content distribution network \(CDN\) is a geographically distributed network of proxy servers to **provide high availability and high performance** by **distributing the service spatially** relative to end-users.

A common use case is to accelerate images, CSS or JavaScript browser loading.

* Force **browser caching** expiration to **4h**
* \*\*\*\*[**Http/2**](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/HTTP/2) support
* \*\*\*\*[**Http/3**](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/HTTP/3) **with** [**QUIC**](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/QUIC) support
