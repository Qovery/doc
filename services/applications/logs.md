# Logs

Once an application is deployed, you can look at the logs with the help of the CLI:

```bash
$ qovery log
Can't connect to Twitter API, please add a Token
Exit
```

 If you have a running application with several logs you would like to **follow in real time**, you can do it with `-f` argument:

```bash
$ qovery log -f
```
