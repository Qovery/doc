# MySQL

[MySQL](https://www.mysql.com/) is the world's most popular open source database. Whether you are a fast growing web property, technology ISV or large enterprise, MySQL can cost-effectively help you deliver high performance, scalable database applications.

## Add a new database instance to an existing application

To **add a new dedicated MySQL instance** to an existing application, you can use update the configuration file by adding these lines:

{% tabs %}
{% tab title=".qovery.yml" %}
```yaml
application:
...
databases:
- type: mysql
  version: "8.0"
  name: my-mysql
```
{% endtab %}
{% endtabs %}

* **name**: the name of your MySQL database
* **version**: the versions of MySQL
* **type**: the database engine

## Access to an instance

To get the connection information of your database, you can use the CLI:

```bash
$ qovery application env list -c
  SCOPE       | KEY                                                         | VALUE     
--------------+-------------------------------------------------------------+-----------
  BUILT_IN    | QOVERY_JSON_B64                                             | <base64>  
  BUILT_IN    | QOVERY_BRANCH_NAME                                          | master    
  BUILT_IN    | QOVERY_IS_PRODUCTION                                        | true      
  BUILT_IN    | QOVERY_DATABASE_MY_MYSQL_NAME                               | my-mysql  
  BUILT_IN    | QOVERY_DATABASE_MY_MYSQL_TYPE                               | MYSQL     
  BUILT_IN    | QOVERY_DATABASE_MY_MYSQL_VERSION                            | 8.0       
  BUILT_IN    | QOVERY_DATABASE_MY_MYSQL_CONNECTION_URI                     | <hidden>  
  BUILT_IN    | QOVERY_DATABASE_MY_MYSQL_CONNECTION_URI_WITHOUT_CREDENTIALS | <hidden>  
  BUILT_IN    | QOVERY_DATABASE_MY_MYSQL_HOST                               | <hidden>  
  BUILT_IN    | QOVERY_DATABASE_MY_MYSQL_FQDN                               | <hidden>  
  BUILT_IN    | QOVERY_DATABASE_MY_MYSQL_PORT                               | <hidden>  
  BUILT_IN    | QOVERY_DATABASE_MY_MYSQL_USERNAME                           | <hidden>  
  BUILT_IN    | QOVERY_DATABASE_MY_MYSQL_PASSWORD                           | <hidden>  
  BUILT_IN    | QOVERY_DATABASE_MY_MYSQL_DATABASE                           | mysql 
```

## Get instance status

To know more about your instance status, you can do it this way:

```bash
$ qovery status -c
...
  DATABASE NAME | STATUS  | TYPE  | VERSION | ENDPOINT | PORT     | USERNAME | PASSWORD | APPLICATIONS    
----------------+---------+-------+---------+----------+----------+----------+----------+-----------------
  my-mysql      | running | MYSQL | 8.0     | <hidden> | <hidden> | <hidden> | <hidden> | simple-example  
```

## Delete a database instance

To delete a database instance, here are the 2 possible solutions:

1. **Remove it from the configuration file**, commit and push.
2. If you worked on feature branch, delete the branch and **the database instance will automatically be deleted** as well.

{% hint style="danger" %}
**Delete action will drop the services and its data!**
{% endhint %}

{% hint style="success" %}
**Backups will be kept for 1 month if you need to recover \(just in case**ðŸ˜‰**\)**
{% endhint %}

## Backups

{% hint style="success" %}
By default, backups are made every day between 1h and 5h.
{% endhint %}

You can change the window very easily \(use 24h format\):

{% tabs %}
{% tab title=".qovery.yml" %}
```yaml
application:
  ...
databases:
  - name: my-mysql
    type: mysql
    backup-window: 21-23
```
{% endtab %}
{% endtabs %}

As described here, the backup will occur between 9PM and 11PM.

## Restore \(coming soon\)

You can restore through the CLI or the web interface.

From the CLI:

```bash
$ qovery restore <database-instance-name>

âž¤ Choose the version you want to restore:
  25/11/2019 - 22h
  24/11/2019 - 22h
> 23/11/2019 - 22h
  22/11/2019 - 22h
  21/11/2019 - 22h
  
âœ“ You're going to restore this backup: 23/11/2019 - 22h

âž¤ Do you want to perform a backup before restoring? (y/n): y

âž¤ Please confirm by typing the database instance name: my-mysql

âœ“ Backup successfuly created
âœ“ Backup as successfuly been restored (23/11/2019 - 22h)
```
